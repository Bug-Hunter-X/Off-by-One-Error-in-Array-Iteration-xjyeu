This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code with the explanation of the bug and its solution.  The bug is related to an incorrect loop condition resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The solution shows how to correct the loop condition to avoid the error.
